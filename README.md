# Power mode

An "wrapper" for "`powerprofilesctl`", the command-line tool for
the power-profiles program.

## What this does?


Hum... Instead of typing:
```
powerprofilesctl performance
```

All you have to do is type:
```
powermode power
```

Convenience huh?

This was created mainly for my own personal benefit, but i'm uploading
this to Github so i don't randomly lose it on a distro-hopping event.

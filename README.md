# Power mode

An "wrapper" for "`powerprofilesctl`", the command-line tool for
the power-profiles program.

## What this does?


Hum... Instead of typing:
```
powerprofilesctl performance
```

All you have to do is type:
```
powermode power
```

Convenience huh?

This was created mainly for my own personal benefit, but i'm uploading
this to GitHub, so I don't randomly lose it on a distro-hopping event.

### Installation

Just grab the file on the releases section and copy it to `/usr/bin`.

### Note: 
"The manual for this software is available on the *src* folder"

# Power mode

An "wrapper" for "`powerprofilesctl`", the command-line tool for
the power-profiles program.

## What this does?


Hum... Instead of typing:
```
powerprofilesctl performance
```

All you have to do is type:
```
powermode power
```

This tool improves overral usability and makes the CLI tool nicer to use.

### Installation

If you are using Arch Linux, power-mode is available on `jocadbz-arch-repo`, a pacman
repository i made for my projects. Instructions at <a href="https://jocadbz.github.io/arch-repo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my site</a>.

If you are using other distro, or don't want to mess with a repository, just grab
the file on the releases section and copy it to `/usr/bin`.
